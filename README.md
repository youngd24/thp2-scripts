Various scripts for The Hacker's Playbook 2 (book)

After picking up the book "The Hacker's Playbook 2" and running through the install a 
couple times I went searching for any scripts to install the packages used througout.
I didn't find any so I wrote one.

As I find other sections in the book where automation can be used I'll write a script
and park it here.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/youngd24/thp-scripts.git /opt/thp2
cd /opt/thp2 
chmod +x thp2-install.sh
./thp2-install.sh -l log.txt
